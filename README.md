# Simple_Calculator
Hi Welcome to my own github repository..
Iam a beginner at python language ...i am font of making some good projects using python and its libraries..and this was a pretty much easier ..So I thought of making a calculator which will handle the basic mathematical operations(+,-,*,/) with graphical ui using the tkinter library..As a beginner iam sort of doing all the operations ..I will upload my advanced calculator soon.

Modules Used:
       Tkinter and its tools such as labels.,Buttons etc..
       
lines of code:
       As this is a simple calculator it takes only 120 lines of code 
       (comments will also be counted)
for buttons seperate functions are used ...And the keywords are given according to the functions and buttons So these program pretty easy to know by urself by just gazing at the code

Happy Coding ^_^
